# Digital Image Processing and Analysis

This repository contains **2 lab exercises** for the **2024–2025 academic year** of the Digital Image Processing and Analysis course at the Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics, University of Patras.

---

## Exercise 1: Fundamental Transforms & Filtering

In this exercise you will implement and explore basic image‐processing operations in the frequency and spatial domains:

- **Frequency‑domain filtering** (DFT/IDFT) on a sample image  
- **2D‑DCT compression** and reconstruction  
- **Noise removal** using mean and median filters  
- **Global and local histogram equalization**  
- **Image restoration** via deconvolution (Wiener filtering)  
- **Edge detection** (e.g. Sobel, Canny) and the Hough transform for line detection  

All code is provided in MATLAB scripts.

## Exercise 2: Machine Learning 

Building on the fundamentals, this exercise covers learning‑based methods and advanced restoration techniques:

- **Convolutional Neural Networks**: train a simple CNN on MNIST for digit classification  
- **HOG + SVM**: extract Histogram‑of‑Oriented‑Gradients features and train an SVM classifier  

Code is provided in python and matlab.
